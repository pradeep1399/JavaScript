/*
Synchronous: Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. 
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complate its execution.

Asynchronous: Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instruction get blocked due to some previous instruction, which causes a delay in the UI.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
